## My experience with using keyboard for navigation

I've been mostly using keyboard for navigation and other purposes for a very long time. I didn't like switching back and forth between keyboard and mousepad and as a web developer, most of my time was utilized in writing enormous lines of CSS and JavaScript so I got more used to keyboard than mouse.

Although, mouse as an input device, was intended to make navigation more convenient and there is some functionality that only mouse can offer such as allowing free movement of cursor on the screen. But what I personally feel is that most of the functionality which both the keyboard and the mouse have in common could be performed using keyboard in a much better and efficient manner. The user simply has to move his or her fingers across the keyboard and press the required key or key combination to perform the desired action. Keyboards can do pretty much anything, from moving across the page and selecting or opening objects/buttons/links to opening and closing tabs or browser windows and switching across them.

However, I feel that it might take some time for anyone to get used to the keyboard's way of navigation.

Provided all this, I am pretty sure that if a person gets used to the keyboard's way of navigation, he or she will definitely like it and would prefer to use it over mousepad. Apart from all of the above, I use keyboard for other things, even for doing things outside the scope of the browser such as switching between apps using `Alt + Tab` to switch between apps, `Ctrl + ALt + T` to open the terminal, `Ctrl + Shift + N` to create a new folder and many other tasks.
