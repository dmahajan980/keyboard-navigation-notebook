# Keyboard Navigation Notebook

A diary/repository for jotting down all relevant observations related to navigating a browser using keyboard keys and shortcuts.

## Keyboard shortcuts and their functionality

Below is the list of keys and keyboard shortcuts that I tried out for navigation using keyboard. Most of these key combinations are being used by me all the time for the corresponding functionality or purpose.

| Keys | Functionality |
| :---: | :---: |
| `↑` or `Up Arrow` | Scrolls up the page |
| `↓` or `Down Arrow` | Scrolls down the page |
| `Spacebar` | Toggles the focused checkbox's state or open/close the focused dropdown list or move down the page at a time |
| `Shift + Spacebar` | Move up the page at a time |
| `Home` | Move to the top of the page |
| `End` | Move to the bottom of the page |
| `Alt + ←` or <br> `Alt + Left Arrow` | Goes back a page |
| `Alt + →` or <br> `Alt + Right Arrow` | Goes forward a page |
| `Tab` | Move from the current focusable item to the next focusable item |
| `Shift + Tab` | Move from the current focusable item to the previous focusable item |
| `Enter` while focused on a hyperlink or an object | Opens the link or the data that the hyperlink redirects to in the current tab or execute the action the object performs. Similar to a mouse click event |
| `Ctrl + Enter` while focused on a hyperlink | Opens the link or the data that the hyperlink redirects to in a new tab |
| `Ctrl + T` | Opens a new browser tab in the current window |
| `Ctrl + Tab` | Move from currently selected browser tab to the next browser tab in the series |
| `Ctrl + Shift + Tab` | Move from currently selected browser tab to the previous browser tab in the series |
| `Ctrl + W` | Closes the current tab |
| `Ctrl + Shift + T` | Reopens the last closed tab (_non-incognito_) |
| `Ctrl + N` | Opens a new browser window |
| `Alt + ~` | Switch between multiple opened browser windows |
| `Ctrl + Shift + N` | Opens a new incognito browser window |
| `Ctrl + Shift + W` | Closes the currently selected window |
| `Ctrl + (+)` | Zoom into the page |
| `Ctrl + (-)` | Zoom out of the page |
| `Ctrl + R` | Refreshes current page |
| `Ctrl + L` | Focuses on the browser's address bar and selects the URL |
| `Ctrl + E` | Focuses on the browser's address bar and prompts for a Google Search |

## My experience with using keyboard for navigation

Before I begin, I would like to clarify that I have been using keyboard shortcuts **from a very long time** for various utilities in the browser including the ones mentioned here for navigation.

I started the task by searching anything random on _google.com_ from _Google Chrome_. I started tabbing (`Tab` / `Shift + Tab`) to navigate across the various search results. The focused element had a blue outline which was same on other websites I opened. I repeated this for _Mozilla Firefox_ and it had also outlined (not blue though) the focused element. So, it seems that all browsers have some predefined outline style for the focused element. I noticed one strange behaviour while navigating. A carousel with two buttons (previous and next), the buttons change color on being focused. This was helpful as a keyboard user, but when I tried clicking on it using mouse, the color doesn't turn back to what it was before the element was focused. Rather it stays as if it is currently being focused, which it shouldn't be after being clicked. This is something I noticed that would be confusing for the mouse user and not the keyboard user. Another thing I noticed was the elements, when they are being hovered by the mouse shows some label. But it was not so in case of keyboard probably due to hover state only available for mouse cursor. This issue could be solved if we pass all the properties of the hover state to the focus state or by using focus state instead of hover state.

Overall, I enjoyed doing the activity/task and I feel that the lessons learnt from this experience shall be helpful during the implementation of some features later in the project.

<!-- I've been mostly using keyboard for navigation (and other purposes) for a very long time. I didn't like switching back and forth between keyboard and mousepad and as a web developer, most of my time was utilized in writing enormous lines of CSS and JavaScript so I got more used to keyboard than mouse. -->

<!-- Although, mouse as an input device, was intended to make navigation more convenient and there is some functionality that only mouse can offer such as allowing free movement of cursor on the screen. But what I personally feel is that most of the functionality which both the keyboard and the mouse have in common could be performed using keyboard in a much better and efficient manner. The user simply has to move his or her fingers across the keyboard and press the required key or key combination to perform the desired action. Keyboards can do pretty much anything, from moving across the page and selecting or opening objects/buttons/links to opening and closing tabs or browser windows and switching across them. -->

<!-- However, I feel that it might take some time for anyone to get used to the keyboard's way of navigation. -->

<!-- Provided all this, I am pretty sure that if a person gets used to the keyboard's way of navigation, he or she will definitely like it and would prefer to use it over mousepad. Apart from all of the above, I use keyboard for other things, even for doing things outside the scope of the browser such as switching between apps using `Alt + Tab` to switch between apps, `Ctrl + ALt + T` to open the terminal, `Ctrl + Shift + N` to create a new folder and many other tasks.  -->
