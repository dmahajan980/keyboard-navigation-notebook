## Keyboard Shortcuts and their Functionality

Some of the majorly used Keyboard shortcuts and the ones that I commonly use are as follows:

| Keys | Functionality |
| :---: | :---: |
| `↑` or `Up Arrow` | Scrolls up the page |
| `↓` or `Down Arrow` | Scrolls down the page |
| `Tab` | Move from current focusable item to the next focusable item |
| `Shift + Tab` | Move from current focusable item to the previous focusable item |
| `Enter` while focused on a hyperlink or an object | Opens the hyperlink or the data that the hyperlink redirects to or execute the action the object performs |
| `F11` | Toggles full-screen mode |
| `Ctrl + Tab` | Move from currently selected browser tab to the next browser tab in the series |
| `Ctrl + Shift + Tab` | Move from currently selected browser tab to the previous browser tab in the series |
| `Ctrl + (+)` | Zoom into the page |
| `Ctrl + (-)` | Zoom out of the page |
| `Ctrl + L` | Focuses on the browser's address bar and highlights the current URL text |
| `Space` | Toggles the focused checkbox's state or open/close the focused dropdown list |

_Note: All these shortcuts are used by me on Google Chrome only. A few of them might not work on other browsers._
